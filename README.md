Congrats! You've stumbled over my humble GitHub profile.

## GitHub announcement

Starting with some recent political announcements and policy
enforcements around this platform, I have opted to use GitHub only
where absolutely necessary. This means I will limit my activity on
this platform to contributing to projects on GitHub, as well as where
other services require it.

To find some of my other projects (and development forks), visit
[git.currently.online/leons](https://git.currently.online/leons/).

Have a nice day!
